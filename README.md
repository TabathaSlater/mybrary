# Mybrary

Mybrary is a personal reading tool that helps you manage your literary goals and accomplishments by providing book tracking, book searching, and reading statistics.
Mybrary utilizes Google Books API to return relevant information about your favorite books, and New York Times Bestsellers API to recommend books you might like.

Styling utilizes a mixture of react-bootstrap and css.
