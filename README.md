# Mybrary

Mybrary is a personal reading tool that helps you manage your literary goals and accomplishments by providing book tracking, book searching, and reading statistics.
Mybrary utilizes Google Books API to return relevant information about your favorite books, and a combination of Google Books API and the New York Times Bestsellers API to recommend books you might like; Mybrary also utilizes Foursquare Places API to find libraries local to a given city.

Styling utilizes a mixture of react-bootstrap and css.
